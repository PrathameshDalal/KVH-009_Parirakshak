README for IP-API Python Script

This Python script demonstrates the use of the requests library to make API requests to the IP-API service. The script can be used to get information about a single IP address or a batch of IP addresses.

Requirements
Python 3.x
requests library (can be installed using pip)
Usage
Download the script or copy the code to your local machine.
Open the script in your preferred Python editor or IDE.
Uncomment the single IP request lines if you want to get information about a single IP address.
Replace the IP address in the single IP request lines with the desired IP address.
Uncomment the batch IP request lines if you want to get information about multiple IP addresses.
Replace the example IP addresses in the batch IP request lines with the desired IP addresses.
Run the script.
The script will make the API requests and print out the results to the console.

API Key
This script does not require an API key to use the IP-API service. However, the IP-API service has a usage limit of 45 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you may receive an error response from the API.
