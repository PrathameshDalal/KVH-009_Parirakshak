# Crime Dectection Alert System

## Summary 

The Kotlin-based application is designed to improve the response time of police responders in the event of a crime. The application uses machine learning to detect the nature of the crime, risk level, and GPS coordinates of the CCTV where the crime has been detected. This information is then used to alert the nearest police station, allowing for a faster response time.

Each crime incident is stored in a database table, which includes the associated nature of the crime and risk level. This information is valuable for analyzing crime trends and patterns over time, allowing authorities to make more informed decisions and take proactive measures to prevent future incidents.

Whenever a new crime incident is added to the database, an alert is triggered in the application in the form of an SMS and push notification. This ensures that authorities are notified of the crime as soon as possible, further improving the response time.

Overall, the Kotlin-based application is an innovative and effective way to improve the efficiency of law enforcement agencies and promote safer communities.
